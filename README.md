## Information

I used the vue project generator (vue-cli). What's mine is everything within the `src/` and `test/` folders. The reason I used a generator, rather than set everything up from scratch, is since this is a UI position I figured I didn't want to spend a lot of time on getting a build chain setup for vue files and what not. The generator gave me all that, plus a very simple web server, which really sped things up for me!

A link for the generator is at the end of this README :)

## TODO

```
